Campaign Managers vs App Managers

Upon login, if user or anyone under them in the org chart owns a campaign, they will see "My Campaigns" 

If not they will just see "Applicable Campaigns" as the home page, with Create Campaign available on the sidebar

Create Campaign will require approval from someone above

Should changes to app status made by app owner require second approval?
